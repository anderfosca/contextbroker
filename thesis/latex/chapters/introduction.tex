The goals of this work are to create a regular Context Broker following previously defined architecture, and to demonstrate the feasibility of the construction of a highly available Context Broker, aiming at a bigger project of a future Dependable Context Broker.

The text is organized as follows: Chapter \ref{chap:definitions} is divided on definitions of Context and Fault Tolerance terms, with Section \ref{sec:context} focusing on the former and Section \ref{sec:fault_tolerance} on the latter. Chapter \ref{chap:implementation} presents the design and implementation of the regular Broker, and the strategies to incorporate High Availability to it. Chapter \ref{chap:tests} shows the tests and comparisons made in this work, and finally Chapter \ref{chap:conclusion} brings the conclusions and future work.
